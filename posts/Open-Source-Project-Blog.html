       With this project, I already knew what kind of community I wanted to contribute to. My first steps were to find a few repositories that met my requirements which in my case, had to be Pokemon-related and mainly HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I originally found five projects which I now have narrowed down to two projects. I decided on these two projects because they are the most recently active and I have an idea of what I can contribute to them. Next, I reached out to the owners of the respected repositories and emailed them. I haven’t heard back from one of them and I’m expecting to hear back soon from the other person and will hopefully chat with them on Discord. The community I’m working with is Pokemon-related. Additional information I found is that most of these Pokemon-related projects use a Pokemon API. I can see myself helping with updating or resolving any CSS-related issues as well as updating the Pokemon library in the projects. A big concern for me is my lack of knowledge and experience with React and Angular. My next steps will be to talk with one of the project creators, decide on one of the two projects, and familiarize myself with Angular or React and the creator’s code. From there, I will finalize how I can contribute to the project.
