      <p>UXN is an emulator or virtual machine that can be used on a plethora of different systems such as a regular computer, browser, or even a Nintendo DS. To run UXN you have to input ROM files and the ROM file serves as cartridges of sorts, at least that's how I think about it. Depending on the ROM file you input you can run a different program on the emulator or virtual machine, such as a notepad or even the snake game. I think the concept and goal of this project is to make use of older, classic, and in a sense simpler software again. From my experience using the software, I believe it does that very well. It runs most classic and simpler programs very well and it is very easy and simple to access and use it. What I find most compelling about the concept of the software is the emphasis on older software and the ease of access and use. In a time where almost everyone is trying to innovate with some crazy new complicated technologies, it's nice to know we can still easily access the classic and simpler software. My only critique is that some ROMs are a little buggy in the emulator and some games are a little difficult to play since the controls are not defined. An alteration I would make to the software is that I would add more retro console compatibility to the software, so one could load and play classic games on it, as well as some sort of save feature.
