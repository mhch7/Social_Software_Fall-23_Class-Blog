      <h1>Responding to Jaron Lanier's On How Social Media Ruins Your Life</h1>
      <h4>9-19-23</h4>
      
      <p>Social media has several very controversial and harmful issues. These issues range from mental health problems to political biases, privacy concerns, etc. To fix and reform social media, we have to have a societal shift away from social media. The public view on social media has to change and there also could be a case of governmental intervention in social media. To give a specific example, TikTok and its algorithm have raised privacy concerns and mental health issues. For example, there are concerns that TikTok shares private data such as location, biometrics, and other personal data with the Chinese government. Furthermore, mental health concerns can be more dangerous. 
      </p>
      <p>Social media in general has been shown to cause depression because of the portrayal of unrealistic standards in different life aspects. What a lot of people fail to realize is that most of it is fake, an act, and most of the time we only see the best of a person on social media. Moreover, TikTok is very addicting and mimics the effects of drugs in the sense that it releases dopamine in the brain and it also has negative effects on one’s attention span as well. Furthermore, TikTok has been shown to affect one’s personality since the algorithm studies you, it shows you content that you will like which in turn keeps you hooked longer. This can lead to mental and personality disorders because the content one consumes starts affecting one’s personality and identity, which can lead to self-diagnosis of mental health conditions. 
      </p>
      <p>What people fail to realize is that social media affects society on a very deep level and in a sense manipulates us all. I find Jaron’s argument convincing and the way to address these concerns is to completely change social media’s business model.
