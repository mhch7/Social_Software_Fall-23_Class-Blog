      <p>The software I’m researching is Pokedex-React by @clementreiffers and @im-rises on GitHub. It's a “Pokédex made in React using the Poképedia API.” Pokedex is a term taken from the Pokemon franchise and in the franchise, a Pokedex is an encyclopedia that has information on all the different Pokemon. The software is a recreation of the Pokedex on a website and has most of the Pokemon. Furthermore, it has different Pokedex descriptions of all the different Pokemon across all different generations of Pokemon games. The software serves fans of the Pokemon franchise. I do not see a code of conduct or contributing document nor a license for the program. I believe it is still under active development and was initially released about a year ago. There’s no direct expectation for the contributors however there is a list of things that need to be fixed and added. The contribution work is done through pull requests on GitHub. They need help with small bugs and a few design issues with CSS. I guess so far I do not have any questions but concerns about my lack of knowledge with react. I believe I can contribute to CSS design and any small CSS bugs they might have.
