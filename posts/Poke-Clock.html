        Project Link: (https://github.com/mhch7/Poke-Clock)
        
        This is an HTML, CSS, and JS clock based on Pokemon Sun and Moon. The form of the Pokemon Lycanroc changes based on whether it is dusk, dawn, or nighttime. The background also changes depending on whether the sun is out or not, and there is also a Pokemon-based font. I’m sharing this project in specific because it is one of my first coding projects that I am actually really proud of. I came up with the concept for it all by myself and it ended up looking exactly how I wanted it to. I selected the “DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO” license because I do not own the rights to the pictures or fonts used in this project and also maybe other people can come up with cool ideas for the project and make it into something unique. This is also the reason why I did not choose any other license, again I do not own rights to the pictures or fonts used in the project and because I want other people to be able to take this project to a new level. With this license, people can use the project in any way they want and I’m alright with that, maybe people will take some inspiration from this project and come up with something new or they can improve in a way I never thought of.
